### The Archive Team ID (`the_archive_team_id`)

> Default value: `FRMDA3XRGC`

A team ID (or team identifier) is generated by Apple and uniquely identifies the developer of an application in Apple's ecosystem.

This workflow uses the team identifier together with [the_archive_bundle_id](#the-archive-bundle-id-the_archive_bundle_id) to get the saved preferences of The Archive.

This value should never need changing.
