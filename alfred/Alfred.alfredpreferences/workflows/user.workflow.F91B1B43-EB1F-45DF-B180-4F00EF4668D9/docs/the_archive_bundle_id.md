### The Archive Bundle ID (`the_archive_bundle_id`)

> Default value: `de.zettelkasten.TheArchive`

A bundle ID (or bundle identifier) uniquely identifies an application in Apple's ecosystem. This means that no two applications can have the same bundle identifier. 

This workflow uses the bundle identifier together with [the_archive_team_id](#the-archive-team-id-the_archive_team_id) to get the saved preferences of The Archive.

This value should never need changing.
